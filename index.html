<h1>DESIGNER. CAT OWNER. MAKER OF BROWNIES.</h1>

<p>I'm Chantel Zapata, a Art Director and Interaction Designer based in NYC. I have ten years of experience in the advertising and graphic design world, specializing in crafting intuitive experiences.</p>
					
<p>I recently graduated from a Front-End Web Development course at General Assembly where I learned HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery and how to be an even better Interaction Designer! During my spare time, I enjoy watching movies, wandering around New York City, and <a href="http://allrecipes.com/recipe/220062/homemade-chocolate-walnut-brownies/">making walnut brownies.</a></p>
